# Loan-Approval-RAG-Chatbot
Welcome to my mini AI project! This is a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that lets you ask questions about a loan approval dataset. It combines document retrieval with a lightweight generative model to answer natural language queries based on the data.

# What is this project about?
This chatbot was built to explore how generative AI can analyse and answer questions from structured datasets (like CSV files). It uses the loan approval prediction dataset from Kaggle and allows users to ask questions like:
* What factors affect loan approval?
* Which property area has the highest approval rate?
* How many applications were approved or rejected?
* What's the average income of approved applicants?

The goal is to bridge data with language using simple machine learning tools.

# How it works
RAG Pipeline Breakdown:
* Document Parsing: The chatbot converts the CSV into readable "chunks" that describe each loan application.
* Semantic Search: It uses SentenceTransformer (MiniLM model) + FAISS to find the most relevant chunks based on your question.

Answer Generation:
A generative model like flan-t5-small processes the chunks and your question to generate a clean, intelligent response.

Streamlit UI:
Everything is presented in a user-friendly web app made using Streamlit.

# Who is this for?
Beginners learning Machine Learning & NLP

Anyone curious about how to combine structured data with GenAI

Students building academic projects with limited computing resources

Rule-based logic handles direct questions (like average income).

For open-ended questions, the LLM kicks in with generative responses.
